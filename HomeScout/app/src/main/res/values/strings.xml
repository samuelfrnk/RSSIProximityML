    <string name="description_text_welcome">This app protects you from malicious
        Bluetooth Low Energy trackers. It detects when such a tracker is following you.
        Therefore, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) needs to be enabled and the app needs your
        permission to scan for BLE devices.

        Also you need to allow the app to use your location. This way the app can determine
        if a tracker is following you.

        Note, no data will be sent to any third party. The data collected from Bluetooth
        and Location remains on your phone.</string>
