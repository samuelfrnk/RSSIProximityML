Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based trackers have been on the market for a while now. Through their integration into so-called Crowd-Sourced Offline Finding Networks (COFN), they have great advantages in terms of affordability and battery life compared to alternative trackers. Since industry leaders such as Apple have commercialized their implementation of this technology, there has been an ongoing discussion about its security aspects and potential misuse. This thesis addressed the issue of whether Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) data combined with a Machine Learning (ML) approach can be used to improve the protection of victims of such misuse. Specifically, AirTags were used to collect a labeled dataset with 13'353 entries. This data set was used in the next step to train and evaluate different classification models and finally integrate one into HomeScout, a protection application developed by the Communication Systems Group of the University of Zurich. A Decision Tree classifier achieved a promising performance score (which incorporates the accuracy, the F1-score and an overfitting penalty) of 84\% and was successfully implemented in HomeScout.
