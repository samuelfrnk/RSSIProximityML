Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based trackers have been on the market for a while now.
Through their integration into so-called Crowd-Sourced Offline Finding Networks (COFN),
they have great advantages in terms of affordability and battery life compared to alterna-
tive trackers. Since industry leaders such as Apple have commercialized their implemen-
tation of this technology, there has been an ongoing discussion about its security aspects
and potential misuse. This thesis addresses the issue of whether Received Signal Strength
Indication (RSSI) data combined with a Machine Learning (ML) approach can be used
to improve the protection of victims of such misuse. Specifically, AirTags were used to
collect a labeled dataset with 13â€™353 entries. This dataset was used in the next step
to train and evaluate different classification models and finally integrate one model into
HomeScout, a protection application developed by the Communication Systems Group
of the University of Zurich. A Decision Tree classifier achieved a promising performance
score (which incorporates the accuracy, the F1-score and an overfitting penalty) of 84%
and was successfully implemented in HomeScout.
